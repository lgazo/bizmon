Business projects management and monitoring application integrating an issue tracker with project budgeting and accounting informations

This is AngularJS example/start-up project showcasing basic possibilities of AngularJS in a more real-world scenario. Maybe it will evolve in a fully functional application one day :)

It uses Maven and Java Jersey REST backend. So in order to work with the project you have to call:

mvn clean install

in the directory where pom.xml is located.




Using AcrIS archetype for generating REST project:

mvn -o archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=sk.seges.acris.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=acris-archetype-rest-server

The application was presented as part of GDG Bratislava (http://www.meetup.com/GTUG-Slovakia) event's presentation about AngularJS.
